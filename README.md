# Clipboard_Hijacker_solved
 The script is designed to replace a specific fake Ethereum address with a user's real Ethereum address. This can help prevent accidental transactions to the wrong address.
 
 # How to Use the Ethereum Address Replacer Script
Install Python: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Python on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Install pyperclip: Once you have Python installed, you'll need to install the pyperclip package. You can do this by opening the command prompt or terminal and running the following command:

pip install pyperclip


Copy your real Ethereum address: Copy your real Ethereum address to the clipboard.

Copy the script: Copy the following script to a text editor, such as Notepad:

Replace YOUR_REAL_ETHERUM_ADDRESS_HERE with your actual Ethereum address.

Save the script: Save the script with a file name of your choice, and with a .py extension. For example, you could save the file as ethereum_address_replacer.py.

Run the script: Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then, run the script by typing the following command:

python clipboard_logger.py

The script will start running and will continuously monitor your clipboard for any instances of the fake Ethereum address. If it detects the fake address, it will replace it with your real address.

Add the script to startup: To make the script run every time you start your computer, you can create a startup task as follows:

Open Notepad and paste the following code:

type:

@echo off
python "C:\path\to\your\script.py"

Replace "C:\path\to\your\script.py" with the path to your Python script. Save the file with the extension .bat.

Press Win+R and type shell:startup to open the Startup folder.

Copy the batch file you created in the previous step to the Startup folder.

Restart your computer to test the startup task.

This will run the batch file, which in turn will run your Python script every time you start your PC.

That's it! With this script running, you should be able to avoid accidentally sending transactions to the wrong Ethereum address.
